# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Documentation

- Read `REQUIREMENTS.md` for functional and non-functional requirements
- Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the implementation plan and phase breakdown
- When requirements change, update both files to keep them consistent
- When updating `REQUIREMENTS.md`, check if `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` needs updates
- When updating `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, verify it matches requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Markdown Writing Guidelines

When writing or editing markdown files:

- Use simple, clear language that's easy to understand
- Avoid jargon and complex terminology unless necessary
- Keep content concise and to the point
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Prefer active voice over passive voice
- Remove unnecessary words and filler content

## Others

- Don't summarise nor create summary files
