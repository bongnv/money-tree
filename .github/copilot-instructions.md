# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Documentation

- Read `REQUIREMENTS.md` for functional and non-functional requirements
- Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the implementation plan and phase breakdown
- When requirements change, update both files to keep them consistent
- When updating `REQUIREMENTS.md`, check if `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` needs updates
- When updating `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, verify it matches requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Coding Guidelines

When writing code:

- Write simple, self-documenting code that explains itself through clear naming and structure
- Use descriptive variable and function names that reveal intent
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering
- Don't generate documentation files (Markdown) unless explicitly instructed
- Let the code speak for itself rather than relying on comments to explain what it does
- Keep documentation minimal or not at all if code is self-documenting

## Markdown Writing Guidelines

When writing or editing markdown files:

- Use simple, clear language that's easy to understand
- Avoid jargon and complex terminology unless necessary
- Keep content concise and to the point
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Prefer active voice over passive voice
- Remove unnecessary words and filler content

## Others

- Don't summarise nor create summary files
